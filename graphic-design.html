            Graphic Design

          <h2>Background and Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            I wanted to expand my skills and knowledge in graphical design, and
            made some logos and illustrations.
          </p>
          <h2>Result</h2>
          <p>
            I got a better understanding of both design principles, such as
            colour and hierarchy, and the tools (Adobe suite).
          </p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        I have always liked to draw, so I wanted to learn vector illustrations.
        I first drew them on paper, then scanned them and adapted in Adobe
        Illustrator.
      </p>

      <img src="images/illustration_phone.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        The illustrations below represent the idea of a product (the swimming
        ring) not being relevant for its customers (the spiky fellows below).

      <p>
        Logos are also an important part of graphic design. Here a fictional
        publishing house got one made by me.
      </p>
      <img src="images/cloud shroud logo.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Another logo, a made up laughing track audio-product, Hillary's canned
        laughter, needed the font adjusted:
      </p>
      <img src="images/hillarys canned laughter logo-08.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        And of course, one needs to put logos on Photoshop-mockups for better
        presentation:
      </p>
      <img src="images/Laughter Mockup.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Finally, a poster to put all my learnin together. It breaks one rule
        deliberately: it serves no purpose other than practice, has no made up
        brief. But it does look neat!
      </p>
      <img src="images/take a look.png" alt="" />
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Graphic design is so much fun, and a skill I intend to expand upon in
          the future!
