          <h2>Background and Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Haaartland is a community platform with apps for web and mobile.
            Users had a hard time signing up as members and to build their
            digital community unaided. <br />The project was for three weeks and
            fully remote. As a UX researcher and designer, I was to improve
            flows and wayfinding, while a dedicated desginer took care of
            visuals and UI. I worked with the Design Thinking process.
          </p>
          <h2>Result</h2>
          <p>
            Optmised flows through shorter user journeys and a tutorial that
            teaches newcomers how to set up their community.

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Empathize</h3>
      <p>
        Starting the Design Thinking process I was to collect data on users and
        the problem at hand:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why was it hard to register?</li>
        <li>And how could we aid in building a community?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Due to the project’s short span however, I decided to iterate the
        research phases (empathize + define) whenever I had the oportunity,
        rather than having a strict research stage in the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went through the registration process and steps for building a
        community as if I were a user, mapping out issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        These I turned into a journey map in Miro. This way I could analyse
        without preconceptions and familiarise myself with the product. To
        deepen my knowledge, I did a stakeholder interview with a project
        leader.
      </p>
      <h3>Ideate</h3>
      <p>
        To find the best way of presenting the step-by-step tutorial for the
        community building tool, I did a remote workshop in Figma with a
        developer. He knew all technical constraints that we had to work with.
      </p>

      <h3>Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        I made the prototype a lo-fi wireframe and non-clickable to save time,
        and because it is sufficiant for trying out the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did two preliminary tests with this setup, which confirmed the format
        was good. Then I updated the prototype into a clickable one before the
        next phase.
      </p>
      <h3>Testing and Empathy 2</h3>
      <p>
        Two business customers were now available for remote user testing. The
        interactive prototype paired with interviews taught me:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The users wanted to do things in another order.</li>
        <li>
          Previous knowledge on digital communities differs between users.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This meant that, for the final handover, I proposed splitting the
          community building into two sessions, making for a more rapid start
          and with the user’s prioritized tasks in the first session.
