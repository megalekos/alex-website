        <h1>Hi! I'm Alex, a designer</h1>
        <p>
            I find the problem hiding behind the problem, and solve it with design. 

Design to me is making decisions, like what strategy to use, or how to give users value.

            Lately, I work for SPIDER. They improve the lives of the poor and marginalised through tech.
Here I learned content-driven design while doing it,
by turning academic reports into short, scannable text, and designing a website around that.
After finding a new way of describing SPIDERs work, I created a content strategy and a new website.

            Before that, I had tried my hand at freelancing, which I still do. Check out my services:

            My first freelance job was for community builder Haaartland. With clear communication to my client, I analysed their flow to make it shorter.

“But is shorter better?” I thought: 
My interviews showed that the users wanted to create a usable community page, before inviting people. So I designed a better order to do things.

            Having done mostly analysis and research, I realised my visual design skills needed polishing, so I delved into graphic design to get the principles right.

            Inspired, I designed this concept:

        Quince, a music streaming service for the curious
      </p>
      <p>
        I could finally apply my aesthetic sensibility from drawing and painting to digital work.

            Speaking of background, I have always loved text. That’s why I studied Literature at university, and why I focus on text and communication in my designs.

Expanding on the Quince concept, I wrote a Tone of Voice guide:

            Personal but succint
Quince provides facts about the world of music, and does so in a personal adress to the user. However, it should not get chatty, because this is an app (thus requiring less text).

            Listen: soft plucks, polyrythms... this must be the West African kora. A unique harp, made from a calabash!
        </p>
        <h2>
            Bad
        </h2>
        <p>
            Wow! I think I’ve heard this on some West African albums. The kora looks kinda funny: it has a calabash as a resonanse body (tunes sweet as a pumpkin!) and 22 strings. Yeah, you can’t make music this cool with less strings. Fact.
