            The quickest way of identifying problems and possibilities on your
            product. It‚Äôs also the first step of all my work, usually, but you
            can buy this service separately. Perfect for small scope projects,
            like simple sites, small apps, sections of larger projects.

            Do you want to find the end goals of your customers? Maybe find new
            ones you didn‚Äôt know whant your services? UX research can find them
            for you, with the power of interviews and triangulation. Or, I can
            test your porduct on real people.

            Hi! I'm Alex,<br />
            a UX designer
          </h1>
          <p>
            I combine user research, UX writing and visual design for holistic
            experiences. I'm especially good at making guides and explanations,
            both internal and customer facing.

      <p id="spider" class="">
        My latest assignment was for SPIDER. They improve the lives of the poor
        and marginalised through tech. Here I learned content-driven design
        while doing it, by finding a new way of describing SPIDERs in short,
        scannable text, and designing a website around that.

        Before that, I tried my hand at freelancing, which I still do.<br />

        My first freelance job was for community builder Haaartland. With clear
        communication to my client, I analysed their flow to make it shorter.
      </p>
      <img src="images/haaartland-mockup.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        ‚ÄúBut is shorter better?‚Äù I thought: My interviews showed that the users
        wanted to create a usable community page, before inviting people. So I
        designed a better order to do things.

      <p>
        Having done mostly analysis and research, I realised my visual design
        skills needed polishing, so I delved into graphic design to get the
        principles right.

        I could finally apply my aesthetic sensibility from drawing and painting
        to digital work.

        Speaking of background, I have always loved text. That‚Äôs why I studied
        Literature at university, and why I focus on text and communication in
        my designs. Expanding on the Quince concept, I wrote a Tone of Voice
        guide:

        <h2>Style</h2>
        <p>
          Style: Personal but succint. Quince provides facts about the world of
          music, and does so in a personal adress to the user. However, it
          should not get chatty, because this is an app (thus requiring less
          text).

          Listen: soft plucks, polyrythms... this must be the West African kora.
          A unique harp, made from a calabash!
        </p>
        <h2>Bad üí©</h2>
        <p>
          Wow! I think I‚Äôve heard this on some West African albums. The kora
          looks kinda funny: it has a calabash as a resonanse body (tunes sweet
          as a pumpkin!) and 22 strings. Yeah, you can‚Äôt make music this cool
          with less strings. Fact.

      />
      <p>
        And that leads me back to what I‚Äôm doing now: combining my skills in
        research, text, visuals and storytelling to create a content driven
        website. If you need help creating meaningful user experiences, drop a
