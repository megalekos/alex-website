            Hi! I'm Alex,<br />
            a designer
          </h1>
          <p>
            I find the problem hiding behind the problem, and solve it with
            design. Design to me is making decisions, like what strategy to use,
            or how to give users value.

        Lately, I work for SPIDER. They improve the lives of the poor and
        marginalised through tech. Here I learned content-driven design while
        doing it, by turning academic reports into short, scannable text, and
        designing a website around that. After finding a new way of describing
        SPIDERs work, I created a content strategy and a new website.

        Before that, I had tried my hand at freelancing, which I still do. Check
        out my services:

        My first freelance job was for community builder Haaartland. With clear
        communication to my client, I analysed their flow to make it shorter.
        “But is shorter better?” I thought: My interviews showed that the users
        wanted to create a usable community page, before inviting people. So I
        designed a better order to do things.

    <div class="project" id="graphic-design">
      <p>
        Having done mostly analysis and research, I realised my visual design
        skills needed polishing, so I delved into graphic design to get the
        principles right.

      <p>Inspired, I designed this concept:</p>

      <p>Quince, a music streaming service for the curious</p>

        I could finally apply my aesthetic sensibility from drawing and painting
        to digital work.

      <p>
        Speaking of background, I have always loved text. That’s why I studied
        Literature at university, and why I focus on text and communication in
        my designs. Expanding on the Quince concept, I wrote a Tone of Voice
        guide:

      <h1>Excerpt</h1>
      <p>
        Personal but succint Quince provides facts about the world of music, and
        does so in a personal adress to the user. However, it should not get
        chatty, because this is an app (thus requiring less text).

        Listen: soft plucks, polyrythms... this must be the West African kora. A
        unique harp, made from a calabash!
      </p>
      <h2>Bad</h2>
      <p>
        Wow! I think I’ve heard this on some West African albums. The kora looks
        kinda funny: it has a calabash as a resonanse body (tunes sweet as a
        pumpkin!) and 22 strings. Yeah, you can’t make music this cool with less
        strings. Fact.
