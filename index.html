            The quickest way of identifying problems and possibilities on your
            product. It‚Äôs also the first step of all my work, usually, but you
            can buy this service separately. Perfect for small scope projects,
            like simple sites, small apps, sections of larger projects.

            Do you want to find the end goals of your customers? Maybe find new
            ones you didn‚Äôt know whant your services? UX research can find them
            for you, with the power of interviews and triangulation. Or, I can
            test your porduct on real people.

            Hi! I'm Alex,<br />

            I find the problem hiding behind the problem, and solve it with
            design. Design to me is making decisions, like what strategy to use,
            or how to give users value.

        Lately, I work for SPIDER. They improve the lives of the poor and
        marginalised through tech. Here I learned content-driven design while
        doing it, by finding a new way of describing SPIDERs in short, scannable
        text, and designing a website around that.

        Before that, I had tried my hand at freelancing, which I still do. Check
        out my services:

    <div class="project" id="haaartland">
      <img src="https://unsplash.it/200/300" alt="" />
      <p>
        My first freelance job was for community builder Haaartland. With clear
        communication to my client, I analysed their flow to make it shorter.
      </p>
      <img src="https://unsplash.it/200/300" alt="" />
      <p>
        ‚ÄúBut is shorter better?‚Äù I thought: My interviews showed that the users
        wanted to create a usable community page, before inviting people. So I
        designed a better order to do things.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="project" id="graphic-design">
      <p>
        Having done mostly analysis and research, I realised my visual design
        skills needed polishing, so I delved into graphic design to get the
        principles right.

      <p>Inspired, I designed this concept:</p>

      <p>Quince, a music streaming service for the curious</p>

        I could finally apply my aesthetic sensibility from drawing and painting
        to digital work.

        Speaking of background, I have always loved text. That‚Äôs why I studied
        Literature at university, and why I focus on text and communication in
        my designs. Expanding on the Quince concept, I wrote a Tone of Voice
        guide:

      <h1>Excerpt</h1>
      <p id="quince-description">
        Style: Personal but succint. Quince provides facts about the world of
        music, and does so in a personal adress to the user. However, it should
        not get chatty, because this is an app (thus requiring less text).
      </p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <h2>Good üéâ</h2>
        <p>
          Listen: soft plucks, polyrythms... this must be the West African kora.
          A unique harp, made from a calabash!
        </p>
        <h2>Bad üí©</h2>
        <p>
          Wow! I think I‚Äôve heard this on some West African albums. The kora
          looks kinda funny: it has a calabash as a resonanse body (tunes sweet
          as a pumpkin!) and 22 strings. Yeah, you can‚Äôt make music this cool
          with less strings. Fact.

      />
      <p>
        And that leads me back to what I‚Äôm doing now: combining my skills in
        research, text, visuals and storytelling to create a content driven
        website. If you need help creating meaningful user experiences, drop a
        line.
