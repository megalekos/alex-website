          <h2>Background and Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            This development organisation needed a better way of describing
            themselves and their work, showcasing strengths and processes. The
            project ran for 6 months.
          </p>
          <h2>Result</h2>
          <p>
            Digital strategies, writing guides and new layouts for the website
            all contribute to telling the story of SPIDER. A design system that
            guides the novice designer paired with a workshop enables continous
            development of the site.

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        To get a picture of how SPIDER’s work is done, I read project reports
        and conducted interviews with program managers. The insights were then
        distilled into visual models and text summaries.
      </p>

      <p>
        The website had to be editable by the team, thus made in Wordpress.
        Since they didn’t have experience in formal UX processes, prototyping
        and so on, I realized a Design system in Figma would be helpful in the
        future for them to create consistant designs.
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="" />
      <p>
        I then held a workshop in using Figma, focusing on wireframing and
        prototyping.<br />
        With summaries and service definitions at hand, I could also design a
        digital strategy, comprising of communication goals, channels and
        appropriate formats.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        SPIDER now has some foundations on how to incorporate design into their
        processes, having all their perspectives melded into an actionable
        digital strategy. With the writing guides they can more uniformly tell
        the story about their work, and they can present this coherently on a
        website with the help of a design system.
